  <h1 class="title text-4xl font-semibold">What is this</h1>
  <div>
    This is a tool that helps you keep up with your lore. You can ask questions about your campaign and the lore keeper
    will try to answer them as best as possible. If the information you ask is not in the lore keeper's database, it
    will
    tell you clearly so. This way you can improve your lore, or just answer <span class="italic">"quickly"</span> to
    your players.
  </div>
  <h2 class="title text-3xl"> How does it works </h2>
  <div>
    The Lore Keeper is a tool that uses a machine learning model to answer questions about your lore. But how can you
    teach him your lore? <br>
    You can load PDFs files in the "<a class="title underline" [routerLink]="['document-loader']">Load Docs</a>"
    section, and the Lore Keeper will split them, read them and learn from them by summarizing the documents, extracting
    keywords and storing the information in an internal memory.

    <h3 class="title text-xl my-3"> (Temporary) Limits</h3>

    Yep unfortunately the Lore Keeper has some limits that in the future I plan to address:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>It can only read PDF files</li>
      <li>Uploading the documents is a computationally expensive operation: the smaller the documents the quicker it
        will be to upload them!
      </li>
      <li>As for now it can only load one document a time</li>
      <li>When you ask questions, the lore keeper will search among the saved documents, please expect some loading
        times and some freezing (you are running an AI model on your browser)
      </li>
      <li>
        A GPU is needed to run the model
      </li>
    </ul>
