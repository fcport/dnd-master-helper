    <h1 class="title mb-4 text-4xl font-semibold">What is this</h1>
    <div>
      This is a tool that helps you keep up with your lore. You can ask questions about your campaign and the lore
      keeper
      will try to answer them as best as possible. If the information you ask is not in the lore keeper's database, it
      will
      tell you clearly so. This way you can improve your lore, or just answer <span class="italic">"quickly"</span> to
      your players.

    <h2 class="title mb-4 text-3xl"> How does it work </h2>
    <div>
      The Lore Keeper is a tool that uses a machine learning model to answer questions about your lore. But how can you
      teach him your lore? <br>
      You can load PDFs files in the "<a class="title underline" [routerLink]="['document-loader']">Load Docs</a>"
      section, and the Lore Keeper will split them, read them and learn from them by summarizing the documents,
      extracting
      keywords and storing the information in an internal memory.

      <h3 class="title text-xl my-3"> (Temporary) Limits</h3>

      Yep unfortunately the Lore Keeper has some limits that I plan to address in the future :
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>It can only read PDF files</li>
        <li>Uploading the documents is a computationally expensive operation: the smaller the documents the quicker it
          will be to upload them!
        </li>
        <li>As for now it can only load one document a time</li>
        <li>When you ask questions, the lore keeper will search among the saved documents, please expect some loading
          times and some freezing (you are running an AI model on your browser)
        </li>
        <li>
          A GPU is needed to run the model
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="title mb-4 text-3xl"> Works Offline! </h2>
    <div>
      The Lore Keeper works without any connection, so even in the deepest of the dungeons you can find answers to your
      questions.
      You will have to be online only the first time you load the page, to download the model.
